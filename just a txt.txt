Mips basics
Examples:

add   rd,rs,rt  # rd = rs + rt (signed addition. overflow is possible)
addu  rd,rs,rt  # rd = rs + rt (unsigned addition)

and   rd,rs,rt  # rd = rs AND rt

sll   rd,rt, N  # rd = rt << N (0<N<31)

If the integers a, b, and c are in registers $t0, $t1 and $t2 respectively, write code for the following:

c = a-b+c

First, lets rewrite this as

c += a-b

One way of coding this would be

add  $t2,$t2,$t0    # c += a

sub  $t2,$t2,$t1    # c -= b

An alternate way would use a temporary register

sub   $t3, $t0, $t1    # t3 = (a-b)
add   $t2, $t2, $t3    # c += t3
.
